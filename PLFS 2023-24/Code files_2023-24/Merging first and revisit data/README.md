## About
NSSO's PLFS 2023-24 contains raw data from first visit to all households (HHs); and additionally, three revisits to every household in the Urban area. You will frequently see the use of data from the first visits alone. Only some users leverage the panel data available for urban households. However, I have not seen this panel data on Urban HHs being combined with Rural HHs to generate one large dataset.

I believe that especially for analysis that rely on individual observations, such as regressions and ML algorithms, this exercise is useful. The notebook in this repo is an attempt to create this unified dataframe. 

Note: Due to memory limitations, I have not uploaded the final dataframe on Github. If you find my approach logical, or have any comments, please reach out to me at [tarunm004@gmail.com]().
