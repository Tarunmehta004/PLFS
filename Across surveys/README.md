## About
This repo contains an analysis of industry wise share of employment in 2011-12 and 2023-24. Results are presented at a 2 digit NIC level. Further, to reduce the number of categories, results have also been aggregated and presented at a 'division' level as per NIC 2008. In gist, we see a decline in employment share of agriculture and manufacturing, while construction showed major gains.
