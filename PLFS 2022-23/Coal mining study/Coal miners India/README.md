## About
India is in the midst of an energy transition. Share of renewables in the power generation is increasing. Although, it hasn't yet resulted in fall in demand for coal, we might just peak in terms of our coal consumption by 2040. Very little is understood about the impact of this coal phasedown on our workers and associated livelihoods. 

Based on raw data from 2022-23 PLFS survey, this repo estimates summary statistics on socio-economic characteristics of workers in coal mining in India. 


## Repo structure

1. `Coal miners India.do`: Do file containing codes for filtering, labelling and generating summary statistics. 
2. `Results.doc`: Compiles results from step-1.
